## Preprocessing
This system expects the data to be processed to be already preprocessed by various NLP analyses (i.e. part-of-speech tagging, parsing and named-entity recognition).
The specific tools for this kind of preprocessing are not included in the release of this system.
However, you may find shellscripts for installing and running these tools in another project here:
https://github.com/miwieg/german-opinion-role-extractor

## Configuration File
```
# Example configuration

# Path specifications
TEXT_INPUT=src/main/resources/Input/raw_text.txt
DEPENDENCY_INPUT= src/main/resources/Input/dependency_parse.txt
CONSTITUENCY_INPUT=src/main/resources/Input/constituency_parse.xml
SENTIMENT_LEXICON_INPUT=src/main/resources/dictionaries/germanlex.txt
SHIFTER_LEXICON_INPUT=src/main/resources/dictionaries/shifter_lex.txt
INTENSIFIER_LEXICON_INPUT=src/main/resources/dictionaries/intensifier_lex.txt
OUTPUT=output/salsaResult.xml

###
# Optional path specifications
# If available, the position of subjective expressions in a sentence may be given to the system.
# The xml-file should be in the same format as the constituency parse file, with additional subjective expression frames.
# constituency_parse.preset_ses.xml provides an example.
# If not available, the sentiment lexicon (SENTIMENT_LEXICON_INPUT) is used to identify subjective expressions and their locations.
PRESET_SE_INPUT=src/main/resources/Input/constituency_parse.preset_ses.xml

# Option to use preset subjective expression information (TRUE), or to use
# the sentiment lexicon for subjective expression identification instead (FALSE).
# If no file is specified for PRESET_SE_INPUT, this option is meaningless.
# Default: TRUE
USE_PRESET_SE_INPUT=TRUE

# Option to also consider neutral entries of germanlex (labeled NEU).
# If set to TRUE, neutral expressions will be labeled as polar expressions,
# but won't affect sentence polarity.
# Default: FALSE
INCLUDE_NEUTRAL_EXPRESSIONS=FALSE
###

# Option for dependency parse normalization.
# Turns passive voice into active voice among other things. Should improve detection and classification.
# Default: TRUE
NORMALIZE=TRUE

# Option to consider POS tags for subjective expressions.
# Compares POS tags of words in a sentence with sentiment lexicon entries.
# If a mismatch between a lexicon entry's POS tag and a corresponding word is found, the word will not be considered to be a subjective
# expression.
# Only meaningful if USE_PRESET_SE_INPUT=FALSE.
# Default: TRUE
POS_LOOKUP_SENTIMENT=TRUE

# Option for pos lookup for shifters.
# The same rules as for POS_LOOKUP_SENTIMENT apply.
# Default: TRUE
POS_LOOKUP_SHIFTER=TRUE

# Option to take shifter orientation as given in the shifter lexicon (SHIFTER_LEXICON_INPUT) into account.
# Example:
    # Shifter: "heilen" with orientation "n" (on negative)" will only shift negative subjective expressions if this option is set to
    # TRUE.
# Default: FALSE = Higher Recall (and probably higher F-Score). TRUE = Higher Precision.
SHIFTER_ORIENTATION_CHECK=FALSE

###
# Window Baseline Module: Checks for shifter targets to the specified direction of a shifter within a given window-based scope.
# Default: FALSE
WINDOW_BASELINE_MODULE=FALSE
# The window size for shifter targets.
# Default size: 4
BASELINE_WINDOW=4
# The direction in which to search for shifter targets.
# Options: "LEFT", "RIGHT", "BOTH"
# Default: BOTH
BASELINE_DIRECTION=BOTH

# Baseline Rule Module: Checks for shifter targets without using specific dependency relations 
# filtered by lexicon scope entries, but instead by looking at all direct dependencies.
# Default: FALSE
CLAUSE_BASELINE_MODULE=FALSE
###
```

## Lexicons
The system uses a sentiment lexicon (Germanlex), a shifter lexicon, and optionally, an intensifier lexicon.

### Sentiment Lexicon - Germanlex
The employed sentiment lexicon ![Germanlex](polcla/src/main/resources/dictionaries/germanlex.txt) comes from PolArt (Klenner et al., 2009).
It contains information about what words express a sentiment, the polarity of the sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) as well as the intensity of the sentiment. And finally, the part of speech of every entry.
Germanlex also contains entries about shifters and intensifiers, although these entries are ignored in the sentiment lexicon, as they get their own lexicons instead.
```
Format: 
Word {NEG|POS|NEU|SHI|INT}=PolarityStrength PoS
SHI for Shifters, INT for Intensifiers
INT < 1, e.g. 0.5 is a reduction factor, > 1, e.g. 2 is a gain factor 

Example entries:
gut POS=1 adj
Unversch√§mtheit NEG=1 nomen
anzweifeln NEG=0.7 verben
```

### Shifter Lexicon
The ![shifter lexicon](polcla/src/main/resources/dictionaries/shifter_lex.txt) contains information about what words should be considered to be shifters, what type of shifter they are, what their scope is, and finally, their part of speech.
The scope is specified with dependency labels. A list dependency labels with explanations and examples can be found here:
https://github.com/rsennrich/ParZu/blob/master/LABELS.md
```
Format:
<shifter> <type> [<scope>] <pos>

Type {n,p,g}
n: The shifter shifts negative sentiment words
p: The shifter shifts positive sentiment words
g: The shifter shifts all (general) sentiment words

Scope [{attr-rev,objg,obja,objd,objc,obji,s,objp-*,subj,gmod,dependent,clause,objp-ohne}]
If the scope is given as "[subj]", only words that are in a subject relation with the shifter will be considered as the shifter target.

Examples:
stagnieren g [subj] verb
verschlimmern p [objg,obja,objd,objc,obji,s,objp-*,subj] verb
gescheitert g [subj,attr-rev] adj
Abspaltung g [gmod,objp-*] nomen
```

### Intensifier Lexicon
The ![intensifier lexicon](polcla/src/main/resources/dictionaries/intensifier_lex.txt) functions in the same way as the shifter lexicon.
In contrast to shifters, intensifiers are thought to increase the strength of a sentiment without changing its direction from positive to negative or the other way around.

```
Format:
<intensifier> <type> [<scope>] <pos>
Type {n,p,g}
Scope [{attr-rev,objg,obja,objd,objc,obji,s,objp-*,subj,gmod,dependent,clause,objp-ohne}]

Examples:
ziemlich g [subj,attr-rev] adj
wirklich g [subj,attr-rev] adj
extrem g [subj,attr-rev] adj
```

## Data
Apart from the lexicons, the system expects raw text, a constituency parse and a dependency parse as ![input](polcla/src/main/resources/Input/.). Optionally, an xml file specifying the position of subjective expressions can be given.
You may find scripts to get the constituency and dependency parses here: https://github.com/miwieg/german-opinion-role-extractor
